# JavaHVAC

JavaHVAC is an Java-based application that can be used to control hydronic solar, radiant heat, and forced air systems. This project is in the initial phases and although I'm writing in in such a way that I can use it for my house, I hope that it can gain community support. 

The communication protocol that it uses is simple JSON based REST, so any other application can talk to it, however, the control and sensor nodes are intended to be RaspberryPis.

I've tried to maintain good practice throughout, but I've taken some shortcuts that I normally wouldn't in a enterprise coding project. I'm working on this only im my spare time, and I need this working prior to winter so I can heat my house.
